- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bennyou-matchbox I started off as a developer and made software for many years, after which I moved into leadership roles. I know run a humble consultancy that tackles challenges at the intersection of People, Technology and Impact.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m super cuirous about Web3 and how it can change the way we (people of the interwebs) work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make some things for Web3 and playing around with Solidity (Ethereum) and Rust (Solana), I'm still a newbie at these things but hope to apply some of my previous experiences over time :)
